 ml salespeople Whit l was doing that enabled me to it“ SO 
 much more than anyone else. I accepted his offer and from 
 that day forward my life was met the same. 

 Within eighteen months I had moved from that job to 
 mining in sales manager with people selling for me. I mounted 
 and built a ninety-ﬁve~permn sales force. I went literally

 goals and how to sell more effectively. In almost no time at

 many of them are millionaires and multimillionaires. 

 It‘s important to note that since those days in my mid

 achieving I ﬁnally decided to collect everything I had learned 
 into a single system. By assembling these ideas and strategies 
 in one place I developed a goal-setting methodology and 
 process with a beginning middle and end and began to fol
